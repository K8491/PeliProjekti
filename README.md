# PeliProjekti
C# oo and WPF-project.
I'm bad at making sounds.
//also the path to sounds is set to [DOCUMENTS]/sounds/lazer.wav
			      -    ||                               -/explosion.wav
HALL OF SHAME (SCORE BOARD)
Game also uses HOS.txt (created into [DOCUMENTS] folder.)

//sound icluded, but those might be just a bit too annoying... to listen...

KEYS:
Arows = movement.
Space = shoot
R = reload
P = pause
